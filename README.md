# CraftSwap Item Swapping Website

![Logo Image](craftswaplogo.png)

A proof-of-concept rather than a fully functional site. Modelled after such sites as PaperbackSwap and BookMooch, I wanted to create a similar item swapping site. Created for a course at Athabasca University, I used the required VB.NET and ASP.NET languages in Visual Studio.
