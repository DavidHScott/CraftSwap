            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>CraftSwap is a community for exchanging used and unwanted craft patterns and plans. This site uses a token system to enable you to
                exchange patterns you no longer want for those you’d like to have. A plan can be anything from a book of quilt patterns to a woodworking
                magazine with a complete project plan included. For the sake of simplicity, all items are valued the same, at one token each.</p>

            <p>Each time you successfully swap one of your patterns for a token, you can use that token to swap it for a pattern from any other 
                user on the site.</p>

            <p>This site is localized for users in Dufferin County, Ontario. You can use this site if you are outside of this area, but you must be willing
                to deliver and pick up your swaps within the boundaries of Dufferin County.</p>

            <p>CraftSwap is owned and operated by David H. Scott of Orangeville, ON. If you have any comments or questions regarding this site, please use

            <h1>Return Policy</h1>

            <p>There is no cost to join or use this web site. Although you can make a one-time purchase of tokens to begin swapping, tokens have no monetary
                value. CraftSwap does not offer refunds or returns on earned or purchased tokens, or on swaps between members.</p>

            <p>You may cancel your CraftSwap account at any time. By cancelling you acknowledge that your earned or purchased tokens will be forfeited, and
                deleted along with your account.</p>
